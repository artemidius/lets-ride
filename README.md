### PROJECT
I have created this project to practice some technologies and approaches. It may serve Demo purposes as well.
At current state application has no useful user functionality. It is rather a sctructure for one of my possible future projects.

### INSPIRATION
Some approaches and solutions were inspired by [Now In Android] project

### BUILDS
Project is based on Gradle Convention Builds & Version Catalog

### DI
Project uses HILT for DI

### MODULARIZATION
Project uses App, Feature, Library modules

### UI
Project uses Jetpack Compose with ViewModel (and Coroutines StateFlow to transfer a state).

### STORAGE
Project uses Room and SharedPrefs to persist data

### TEST
JUnit, Mockito, Robolectric

### CI/CD
Check out pipelines on [GitLab CI]
