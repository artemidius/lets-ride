### PROJECT
The application idea is to connect motorcyclists to organize group rides and community activities. 
And also help bikers and passingers find each other to ride and travel togeather.

I have created this project to practice some technologies and approaches. It may serve Demo purposes as well.
Application is still in W.I.P state. Here's what we have so far.
